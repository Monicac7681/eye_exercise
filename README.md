# Project Title: Eye_exercise

## Description
  
In this exercise, I used a CSS style sheet to display the looks of two eyes on the HTML page. The eyeballs follow the movement of the viewer's mouse position within the browser. 

## How to Run:

Once the webpage is loaded, the viewer moves their mouse and see the eyeball movement. This exercise doesn't require any additional installation. 

## Roadmap of future improvements:

I set the eyeball in a lime-green color to mimic an alien eye. I plan to populate this webpage with many more eyes in various sizes. I also want to make the eyeballs stare at the mouse instead of simply following the mouse.
